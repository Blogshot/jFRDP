# jFRDP

A graphical user interface (GUI) for FreeRDP (https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP) written in Java for MacOS/Unix in general.

You can manage and use various RDP-Connections without the hassle of a commandline interface.

Keep in mind that this is in early development since I work on this in my spare time.
